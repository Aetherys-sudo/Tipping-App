TIPPING APP:

This app was made as a result of wanting to get a bit more familiar with the Kotlin programming language and the Android Studio IDE.

The UI was made using Jetpack Compose.

The functionality of the app is quite simple, the user enters the bill amount and the percentage they would like to leave as a tip. The app gives the option to round up the tip amount as well.
